Five years ago, consumers may not have heard of the brand Huawei. Today, it is the third
 largest
 smartphone manufacturer by market share. Indeed, its growth has been impressive and
 phenomenal. From 2012 to 2016, Huawei more than doubled its annual sales revenue to 
 USD 75 billion with more than half of that coming from outside China.

Some of its key success factors include unwavering commitment to R&D investment and spending, 
its engaging corporate branding and marketing campaigns, and its effective pricing strategy 
targeting the right consumer segment. These are all valuable takeaways for brands that want to 
excel on the global stage.
