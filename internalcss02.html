External Styles
External style sheets are the most common method of applying styles to a website. Most modern websites use an external stylesheet to apply site-wide styles to the whole website.

External styles refer to creating a separate file that contains all style information. This file is then linked to from as many HTML pages as you like. This will often be the whole website.

To add an external stylesheet to a web page, use the <link> tag, providing the URL of the style sheet in the href attribute, as well as rel="stylesheet".

For the following example, I've taken the styles from the above (embedded) example, moved them to an external style sheet, then linked to that file.
