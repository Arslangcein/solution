BlackBerry was the absolute nuts. It offered something all its competitors 
couldn't touch - access to emails on the go. Even if you didn't own a Blackberry yourself, you 
can bet your bottom dollar that you knew someone that did, or that you would at least see one in 
the hands of someone else on a regular basis.

That physical QWERTY keyboard with its tap, tap, tapping could be heard in every train carriage 
and on every plane. It wasn't just about emailing on the go though. You also had BBM - BlackBerry
's Instant Messenger service. It might be all about WhatsApp now, but BBM had read receipts down
 donkey's years ago. It was yet another unique reason to buy a BlackBerry, appealing to a huge 
 range of people, not just the ones in suits.
