                 <b> Do you know that nearly 200 websites are pushed out
				 every minute? Sounds astonishing right? But it is a fact
				 and that’s why it is important that every entrepreneur 
				 and developer know about the current web development trends.

There are a total of 200 million active websites present out there, while
 the combined count of total inactive and active sites will be ten times
 more than this number. The websites have been making a high impact on the
 market and businesses are using these websites to establish a strong online presence.

These statistics not only represent the pool of resources, but it also
 the intense competition present between websites. One of the best ways
 to stay ahead of this competition is by staying up-to-date with the latest trends. 
 It is important to 
know what will be trending in the future and implement those trends into web development.</b>

	                     <b> A recent study that was conducted has shown that people spend 85% of their time on mobile apps. Progressive web apps are web pages that appear like mobile applications for users. If they are preloaded on the device then the user can access them even without an internet connection. The users will get the feel of using an application rather than the website. The aim of these Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) is to provide a native-like experience for the users on all platforms.

A Google report has stated that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if 
the web page takes more than three seconds to load. Progressive web apps 
solve this problem perfectly. It combines the best of the web and native 
applications providing a good feel to the users. The users will get the 
feel of using an app without even installing it.

The PWA gives a full-screen appearance to users and the URL of the site 
will not be visible. The brand identity will be visible in a stronger way.
 In order to mimic native apps, PWAs also provide push notifications to users. 
 The publisher will have the full rights of these push notifications, and they 
 can send them when necessary directly to the user’s mobile.

This way users will also be able to connect to your website whenever they


 need, allowing them to re-engage with your site. This is usually not possible with normal websites. Users will be able to share this web content for any apps that are present on their mobiles. The sharing isn’t only confined to apps like Twitter or Facebook.

Users will be a ble to do all these things without any data connection via PWAs. This is one of the best reasons to rely on PWAs. All the content that you post on your PWA will be available for the users even when the internet connection is poor.</b>
