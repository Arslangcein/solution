<h1>The Secret History of iPhone</h1>
<h2>

Twelve years ago this month Steve Jobs announced a wide-screen iPod with touch controls, 
a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet device.
But it wasn't three products. It was one product. And we got it, Steve. We got iPhone.
</h2>
<pre align="center">
On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs put sneaker to stage for what was the most incredible keynote
 presentations of his life—a life filled with incredible keynote presentations—and in the history
 of consumer electronics.

The company had been working for over two years on the Purple Experience Project. It had gone 
from a tablet to a phone. From a dream to reality. And just before he stepped out in front of 
the crowd, Jobs assembled his team and told them to remember the moment: The moment before iPhone.
Because, in the next moment, everything would change.</pre>
<pre align="center">
During the keynote, Steve Jobs said it was rare enough for a company to revolutionize even 
one product category. Apple had already
 revolutionized two: Computers with the Mac and personal music players with the iPod. With
 the iPhone they'd be going for three.

He set up and knocked down the physical keyboard and the stylus, features that dominated the
 BlackBerry, Motorola, and Palm smartphones of the day. Then Jobs introduced the multitouch 
 interface that let the iPhone smoothly pinch-to-zoom, the physics-based interactivity that 
 included inertial scrolling and rubberbanding, and the multitasking that let him move seamlessly
 from music to call to web to email and back.

They were technologies that would one day become commonplace across the industry but back then
 looked like science-fiction. From Apple:

<h1>Huawei – Transforming A Chinese Technology Business To A Global Brand</h1>

<pre align="center">
Mention “Huawei” and most people would immediately associate the brand with the latest, 
high-quality technological products. Indeed, the Huawei brand has come a long way since it
 was founded in 1987. Within a short 30-year history, Huawei is today a global behemoth competing
 against the likes of Apple and Samsung. This begs the question: what is the secret to Huawei’s 
 rapid brand success? This article seeks to unravel some of the key factors to Huawei’s accomplishments.
Huawei Technologies was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, China as a rural sales agent for Hong 
Kong-based 
phone and cable network businesses. In the 1996 to 1998 period, Huawei first expanded into 
metropolitan areas of China as urban populations exploded.

Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that China’s urban population 
will hit the one billion mark by 2030 and have 221 cities with over one million inhabitants by 
2025 compared to 35 in Europe. Vast cities require complex communication networks and Huawei has
 continued to grow at an astounding rate by expanding on and servicing this need.

Today, Huawei’s products and solutions are deployed in over 170 countries, and serving more 
than one third of the global population. Huawei is the third-biggest global manufacturer of 
routers, switches and other telecommunications equipment by market share after Alcatel-Lucent 
and Cisco, and the brand recently joined in the ultra-competitive smartphone race.

For many observers, Huawei has seemingly come out of nowhere to become one of the world’s most
 dominant technology brands. Primarily a business-to-business company (B2B), its biggest gains
 have been outside of the public eye. Major customers include telephone and internet operators,
 which use Huawei’s expertise to provide services to customers under their brand name, 
 not Huawei’s brand. It also lacked worldwide fame due to its Chinese origins. With up to 
 one-fifth of the world’s population within its own Chinese borders, Huawei has been able 
 to grow while still remaining relatively isolated.

 <h2> Huawei has great untapped global growth potential</h2>
 <pre align="center">
Five years ago, consumers may not have heard of the brand Huawei. Today, it is the third
 largest
 smartphone manufacturer by market share. Indeed, its growth has been impressive and
 phenomenal. From 2012 to 2016, Huawei more than doubled its annual sales revenue to 
 USD 75 billion with more than half of that coming from outside China.

Some of its key success factors include unwavering commitment to R&D investment and spending, 
its engaging corporate branding and marketing campaigns, and its effective pricing strategy 
targeting the right consumer segment. These are all valuable takeaways for brands that want to 
excel on the global stage.

However, Huawei still has a relatively weak presence in the South Asian, Indian, and North 
American markets, which limits its potential to take a sustainable second place position behind 
Samsung. The board and business management of Huawei will need to take a closer look at the 
company’s entire global business strategy and determine the next important steps for Huawei. 
If Huawei aspires to become the world’s leader in the global information and communications 
technology sector, it requires bold, daring and different decisions.

<h1>History Of The Sony Xperia Flagships</h1>
<pre align="center">
Sony has been in the smartphone game from the very beginning, pretty much, and the company had
 revealed quite a few flagship smartphones to date. Sony has been releasing several flagships 
 per year, and is one of those companies that rebranded its flagship series more than one. The
 Sony Xperia Z flagship series was born way back in January 2013, when a phone with that name 
 was announced. Sony has been releasing devices under the Xperia Z series until February 2016, 
 when the Xperia X landed, and replaced the Xperia Z5, ushering in Sony’s X series of flagships
 , which quickly became the XZ series of flagships.

 <pre align="center">
 The company’s Xperia XZ series of phones lasted until 2019, when the company decided to rebrand
 its flagships once again, and this time around Sony opted for a much simpler name for its new 
 flagship, as it ended up calling it the Xperia 1. If you’d like to know more about the history 
 of the company’s flagship smartphone series, read on, as you’ll find all of the company’s 
 flagship smartphones listed down below along with more info

<h1>The History of Blackberry</h1>
<h2 align="center"> The best BlackBerry phones that changed the world</h2>
<pre align="center">
Once upon a time, BlackBerry was the absolute nuts. It offered something all its competitors 
couldn't touch - access to emails on the go. Even if you didn't own a Blackberry yourself, you 
can bet your bottom dollar that you knew someone that did, or that you would at least see one in 
the hands of someone else on a regular basis.

That physical QWERTY keyboard with its tap, tap, tapping could be heard in every train carriage 
and on every plane. It wasn't just about emailing on the go though. You also had BBM - BlackBerry
's Instant Messenger service. It might be all about WhatsApp now, but BBM had read receipts down
 donkey's years ago. It was yet another unique reason to buy a BlackBerry, appealing to a huge 
 range of people, not just the ones in suits.

 <pre align="center">
 Sadly, those days are gone and while BlackBerry may still have millions of users, it's lost its
 mojo. We've taken a look back to where it all began. This gallery will take you on a BlackBerry 
 journey, from the first handheld device in 1999, right up to where we are now in Android land. 
 We haven't included every device ever announced by BlackBerry because none of us have all day, 
 but you will find all the significant launches in the last two decades.

LG's flagship series of smartphones changed quite a bit over the years, which was to be expected, 
as it has been seven years since the very first handset in the series made an appearance. The 
phones not only go considerably larger, but the design changed considerably, as bezels got thinner
, phones got narrower, and so on. In this article, you will get a good idea what happened over 
time, and be able to access some additional information regarding every phone as well. It is also 
worth noting that this update will be updated as new G series smartphones get announced.
