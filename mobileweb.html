	    <p align="justify">The History of Search Engine Optimization A difficult problem with writing a history of search engine optimization (SEO) is the obscure etiology of its birth. By default, the term search engine optimization implies a relevant history must be considered after the development of search engines. A troublesome aspect of this implication is the fact that search engines and the Internet did not always have their modern form. For example, the Internet arguably can trace its roots back to 1958 when AT&T introduced the first commercial modem, enabling remote computers to communicate over ordinary telephone lines. While the Internet’s technical roots were already in use, the term “Internet” did not actually come into existence until December 1974 when the term was adopted in Request for Comments (RFC) 675 published on the Internet Transmission Control Program. Around this same time, “an Internet” gained more common use as ARPANET was interlinked with NSFNet to mean any internetwork using TCP/IP.
        </p>
	    <p align="justify">As the Internet evolved, greater insight into the need to organize and find distributed data inspired developers to create some means to search for information. In 1990, the first identified search engine was created as a school project and was a text-based index of “archived” and shared File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files – thus came the name “Archie” because the name fit length parameters. This tool did not resemble today’s modern form of a search engine with a front-end graphical user interface and back-end complex algorithms finding, collecting and organizing information. Like the Internet, search engines evolved as advances were made in technology, and as needs arose.
          For example, in 1992, Gopher became the first search engine using a hypertext paradigm. Only a year later, the graphical Mosaic web browser improved Gopher’s primarily text-based interface. About the same time, Wandex became the first search engine to crawl the web indexing and searching indexed pages on the web. By 1998, the major search engines found today were in development.
	    </p>
	    <p align="justify">SEO symptomatically grew out of the development of search engines and the World Wide Web. As natural language search capabilities were designed in search engine tools, relevancy of ranked results was discovered to have significance on traffic coming to web pages. Rather than the web just being a collection of shared files, the World Wide Web opened up concepts of e-commerce and internet marketing. With new avenues of sales to be gained, companies found value in creating and promoting their websites.
        The earliest pioneers in the field of SEO also found the Internet not only interesting, but a viable industry money maker. For example in 1994, Greg Boser discovered that he could use the Internet to sell protective foam equipment to fight fires. He built a website and started seeking ways to drive potential customers to his site for sales.
