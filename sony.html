<h1>History Of The Sony Xperia Flagships</h1>
<pre align="center">
Sony has been in the smartphone game from the very beginning, pretty much, and the company had
 revealed quite a few flagship smartphones to date. Sony has been releasing several flagships 
 per year, and is one of those companies that rebranded its flagship series more than one. The
 Sony Xperia Z flagship series was born way back in January 2013, when a phone with that name 
 was announced. Sony has been releasing devices under the Xperia Z series until February 2016, 
 when the Xperia X landed, and replaced the Xperia Z5, ushering in Sony’s X series of flagships
 , which quickly became the XZ series of flagships.
