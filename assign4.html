	<h3 align="left">What does Mobile Phone mean?</h3>
	<p align="center">
	From its humble beginning in 1865 as a single paper mill operation,
	Nokia has found and nurtured success over the years in a range of 
	industrial sectors including cable, paper products, rubber boots, 
	tires, televisions and mobile phones.Verizon Wireless is our top pick 
	of cell phone carriers thanks to its strong 
 network performance. It has the best coverage, reliability and speed of any 
 carrier we evaluated. T-Mobile also fared well in our assessment. In particular, 
  we are huge fans of its Unlimited 55+ plan, which offers discounted rates to seniors.
 T-Mobile’s prepaid subsidiary, Metro by T-Mobile, is our pick for the best cheap 
 cell phone service because of its great performance and budget-friendly prices. </p>

 What does Mobile Phone mean?
A mobile phone is a wireless handheld device that allows users to make and 
receive calls and to send text messages, among other features. The earliest
 generation of mobile phones could only make and receive calls. Today’s mobile
 phones, however, are packed with many additional features, such as web browsers,
 games, cameras, video players and even navigational systems.

A mobile phone may also be known as a cellular phone or simply a cell phone.
A mobile phone typically operates on a cellular network, which is composed 
of cell sites scattered throughout cities, countrysides and even mountainous
 regions. If a user happens to be located in an area where there is no signal 
 from any cell site belonging to the cellular network provider he or she is 
 subscribed to, calls cannot be placed or received in that location.

<h2>Techopedia explains Mobile Phone</h2>
<p align="center">

When the first mobile phones were introduced, their only function was to make and receive calls, 
and they were so bulky it was impossible to carry them in a pocket.
A mobile phone may also be known as a cellular phone or simply a cell phone.
A mobile phone typically operates on a cellular network, which is composed 
of cell sites scattered throughout cities, countrysides and even mountainous
 regions. If a user happens to be located in an area where there is no signal 
 from any cell site belonging to the cellular network provider he or she is 
 subscribed to, calls cannot be placed or received in that location.
Later, mobile phones belonging to the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) 
network became capable of sending and receiving text messages.

                <br>
				As these devices evolved,
 they became smaller and more features were added, such as multimedia messaging service 
 (MMS), which allowed users to send and receive
 images. Most of these MMS-capable devices were also equipped with cameras,
 which allowed users to capture photos, add captions, and send them to friends
 and relatives who also had MMS-capable phones.

A mobile phone with advanced features similar to a computer is called a 
smartphone, while a regular mobile phone is known as a feature phone.

A smartphone is a mobile phone with highly advanced features. 
A typical smartphone has a high-resolution touch screen display, 
WiFi connectivity, Web browsing capabilities, and the ability to 
accept sophisticated applications. The majority of these devices 
run on any of these popular mobile operating systems: 
Android, Symbian, iOS, BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile.

<h2 align="left">What does WebOS mean?</h2>
<p align="center">

WebOS is a Linux-based proprietary mobile operating system. This mobile 
OS runs on devices like Palm Pre phones, Palm Pixi phones and the HP Veer. 
Originally designed for Palm, and generally written as "webOS," it is now
 currently owned by Hewlett-Packard Co. after it acquired Palm in 2010. As 
 of August 2011, Hewlett Packard announced it would no longer be manufacturing webOS 
hardware but would look into options for licensing to other manufacturers.
