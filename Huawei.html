<h1>Huawei – Transforming A Chinese Technology Business To A Global Brand</h1>

<pre align="center">
Mention “Huawei” and most people would immediately associate the brand with the latest, 
high-quality technological products. Indeed, the Huawei brand has come a long way since it
 was founded in 1987. Within a short 30-year history, Huawei is today a global behemoth competing
 against the likes of Apple and Samsung. This begs the question: what is the secret to Huawei’s 
 rapid brand success? This article seeks to unravel some of the key factors to Huawei’s accomplishments.
Huawei Technologies was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, China as a rural sales agent for Hong 
Kong-based 
phone and cable network businesses. In the 1996 to 1998 period, Huawei first expanded into 
metropolitan areas of China as urban populations exploded.

Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that China’s urban population 
will hit the one billion mark by 2030 and have 221 cities with over one million inhabitants by 
2025 compared to 35 in Europe. Vast cities require complex communication networks and Huawei has
 continued to grow at an astounding rate by expanding on and servicing this need.

Today, Huawei’s products and solutions are deployed in over 170 countries, and serving more 
than one third of the global population. Huawei is the third-biggest global manufacturer of 
routers, switches and other telecommunications equipment by market share after Alcatel-Lucent 
and Cisco, and the brand recently joined in the ultra-competitive smartphone race.

For many observers, Huawei has seemingly come out of nowhere to become one of the world’s most
 dominant technology brands. Primarily a business-to-business company (B2B), its biggest gains
 have been outside of the public eye. Major customers include telephone and internet operators,
 which use Huawei’s expertise to provide services to customers under their brand name, 
 not Huawei’s brand. It also lacked worldwide fame due to its Chinese origins. With up to 
 one-fifth of the world’s population within its own Chinese borders, Huawei has been able 
 to grow while still remaining relatively isolated.

 <h2> Huawei has great untapped global growth potential</h2>
 <pre align="center">
Five years ago, consumers may not have heard of the brand Huawei. Today, it is the third
 largest
 smartphone manufacturer by market share. Indeed, its growth has been impressive and
 phenomenal. From 2012 to 2016, Huawei more than doubled its annual sales revenue to 
 USD 75 billion with more than half of that coming from outside China.

Some of its key success factors include unwavering commitment to R&D investment and spending, 
its engaging corporate branding and marketing campaigns, and its effective pricing strategy 
targeting the right consumer segment. These are all valuable takeaways for brands that want to 
excel on the global stage.

However, Huawei still has a relatively weak presence in the South Asian, Indian, and North 
American markets, which limits its potential to take a sustainable second place position behind 
Samsung. The board and business management of Huawei will need to take a closer look at the 
company’s entire global business strategy and determine the next important steps for Huawei. 
If Huawei aspires to become the world’s leader in the global information and communications 
technology sector, it requires bold, daring and different decisions.
